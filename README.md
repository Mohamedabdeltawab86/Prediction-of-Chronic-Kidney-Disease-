Web Application for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Classification based on ML algorithms. 
Project Link: https://ckdclassification.herokuapp.com/


## Problem Definition
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients are at higher risk for more severe illness. Due
to immunosuppression, the kidney disease patients who appear most at risk for
COVID-19 [1]. The complications of CKD are high blood pressure, anemia (low blood
count), and poor nutritional health. So, developing a model to classify CKD patients is
needed and an important to avoid the risk of this disease.

### CKD Features
The Chronic Kidney Disease data consists of 25 features including class feature. CKD
is binary classification data (CKD or not_CKD). Besides, CKD includes 400 number of
instances [2].

Numeric features include 'id', 'age', 'blood pressure', 'specific gravity', 'albumin', 'sugar',
blood_glucose_random', 'blood urea', 'serum creatinine', 'sodium', 'potassium', and
'haemoglobin'
Categorical features include red_blood_cells', 'pus_cell', 'pus_cell_clumps', 'bacteria',
'packed_cell_volume', 'white_blood_cell_count', 'red_blood_cell_count',
'hypertension', 'diabetes_mellitus', 'coronary_artery_disease',
'appetite', 'pedal_edema', and 'anemia'.
